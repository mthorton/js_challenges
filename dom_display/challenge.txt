5 things to do if we have time

1) create an html / css / js page and link them
2) add a button on the html page that fires a function
3) write a function that uses fetch to get an array of films
4) write a function that uses this array to display results 
5) make the page look nice

Bonus:
1) use bootstrap to display nice cards for each element
2) add a button for each item displayed that removes it from the screen
